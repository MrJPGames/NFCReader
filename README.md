# NFCReader
An UID Reader for N3DS!

Currently only reads 0x4 UID's, most common RFID tags use this length for their UID's.

Possible future additions:<br>
1. List of recently scanned UID's<br>
2. Save UID's to file immeditaly (.txt)<br>
3. Read out .txt with UID's and display this list on screen.<br>
