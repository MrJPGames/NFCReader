# NFCReader
An UID Reader for N3DS!

Currently only reads 0x4 UID's, most common RFID tags use this length for their UID's.

Possible future additions:<br>
1. List of recently scanned UID's<br>
2. Save UID's to file immeditaly (.txt)<br>
3. Read out .txt with UID's and display this list on screen.<br>

Please note:<br>
This was created in my high school days for fun. It is designed to scan the specific type of RFID tag my high school used. And it will only show the UID (which is the part my high school used for their systems). It does not do anythings other than that, not will it ever (unless you fork it I guess ;))
